# conf-questions

At many conferences or other events, talks have a question-and-answer period at the end. Usually, audience members just raise their hands and shout their question when called on. If the space is big, they may form a line to ask questions at a mic.

There are various problems with this approach. First of all, it selects for people who are more comfortable expressing their confusion (or opinions) in front of a crowd. Also, without any ability to screen questions, you have no sense if you’re answering the most critical ones, and you may (probably!) end up with questioners who are really just looking to provide commentary that eats the remaining time.

To fix these issues, [some speakers have moved to an index card system](http://blog.valerieaurora.org/2015/06/23/ban-boring-mike-based-qa-sessions-and-use-index-cards-instead/) that makes it easier for more reserved people to participate and allows the speaker to select what they think are more important questions.

This Web app is basically a digital version of the index card system, which allows for some improvements.

* It eliminates the overhead of distributing and collecting index cards and pens, which doesn’t scale well.
* It potentially allows the audience to “me too” questions, giving a better sense of which questions are most helpful to the audience.[†]
* It allows people who may be watching a live stream in a different room or country to participate.
* The speaker can choose to answer questions as they arise, without falling back to hand-raising.

**NB**: There is a commercial product that is similiar to what this intends to be. It’s available (with a $0 plan) at https://sli.do/.
